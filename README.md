# About C++ Programming
- Developed by Bjarne Stroustrup in 1979
- Statically-typed, multi-paradigm, general purpose middle-level programming language based on C.
- Many operating systems, system drivers, browsers, and games use C++ as core language.

# Features of C++ Programming
## Speed
- C++ is an extended version of C, the C part is very low level. 
- This offers a huge boost in speed that high-level languages like Python and Java CAN'T provide.

## Statically typed
- It does not allow the compiler to make assumptions about the type of data.
- EX: 10 is different from "10" and it must be declared explicitly. 
- These are determined at compile-time, it helps the compiler catch errors and bugs before the execution of the program.

## Multi-Paradigm programming language
- C++ supports at least 7 different styles of programming and gives developers the freedom to choose as needed.
- Unlike Java, you don't need to use objects to solve every task unless necessary.

## Object-Oriented
- C++ supports Object-Oriented programming, to provide a clear modular structure for programs.
- You are able to divide these complex problems into smaller sets by creaing objects. 

## Standard template library (STL)
- The use of C++ can be further extended using the standard library it contains.
- These libraries contain efficient algorithms that you can use while coding your own projects. 
- This saves A LOT of programming effort, to remove re-coding simple common things. 


# Why learn C++?
1. **Irreplaceability**
   - With the use of C++ in the development of modern games, operating systems, browsers, etc, C++ is here to stay.
   - Many major companies like Adobe, Amazon, Google, and Facebook use C++.
2. **To learn the internal architecture of a computer**
   - C++ is a middle-level language so you will write code that interacts directly with the internal hardware of the computer.
   - You will understand how computer memory works and how information can be stored and retrieved.
   - It will expand your knowledge on the architecture of the computer.
3. **Active Community and Open Source Projects**
   - Large supporting community.
   - Lots of online forums to search for help when debugging. 
   - With C++, you can contribute to large open-source projects that impact millions of people.
   - Some larger open source projects with C++ being used is TensorFlow, Electron, OpenCV, etc.
4. **Familiarity with programming**
   - A lot of popular programming languages are based on C and C++
   - If you know C & C++, it will be easier to learn new languages.
5. **Job Opportunities**
   - C++ devlopers can expect average salary of $100,000
   - Requirement of jobs comes mostly from game development, rendering engines, and creating Windows applications. 
   
   
# How to get better at C++?
## Learning by doing
- You must practice with real projects
- Don't just copy other's code and run it.
- Take time to think about what the code actually does.

## Follow C++ standards
- https://isocpp.org/wiki/faq/coding-standards
- http://isocpp.github.io/CppCoreGuidelines/CppCoreGuidelines
- Helpful when scaling your program and advancing in C++.

## Read C++ code written by others
- Join github open-source projects https://github.com/trending/cpp
- Use Code Whittling to start small and only focus on one thing at a time. http://patrick.lioi.net/2013/01/03/code-whittling/
- You will learn other's styles of coding and understand how they think.

## Join C++ communities
1. **StackOverflow** - Most Popular programming Q&A site on the web
2. **Codechef** - Practice questions, challenges and a large community of programmers
3. **CodeProject** - For those who code, with in-depth articles and a huge community of coders
